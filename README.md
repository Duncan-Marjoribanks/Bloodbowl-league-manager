# Bloodbowl-league-manager
A personal project for week 5 Code Clan.

This web app was a personal project to shore up learning using Ruby, PostgreSQL, SQL and Sinatra.
It is a Bloodbowl game tracker app which allows the user to input a series of teams into a local database
and to keep track of which teams have played against each other. It also records the scores.

The app requires a local database be set up named "bloodbowl" with the "db/bloodbowl.sql" file as the source.

Before running the app in ruby for the first time, please run the db/seeds.rb file in ruby to seed the data.

The app may then be run using the app.rb in Ruby.

It runs using Sinatra and will be accessible as a localhost/4567 in your browser.
